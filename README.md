# Social-Security-Solution-
A web-based security and society management system built using PHP, MySQL, and Bootstrap 5. Designed for gated communities to simplify visitor entry management, resident approvals, regular vendor tracking, maintenance management, and role-based administration.

The Society Security Solution System helps streamline communication between Admin, Supervisor, and Residents.
Each role has its own dashboard and set of permissions.

The system ensures that:
  Visitors cannot enter without resident approval.
  Supervisors track all check-ins / check-outs.
  Admin manages flats, buildings, users, and staff.
  Residents can view visitor history, regular helpers, and maintenance details.
